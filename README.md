# Masked
## Face Mask Detector using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV

 
 Training.py is the main script that uses keras,Tensorflow, MobileNet to train the images stored in the dataset folder.
 
 
 Dataset folder contains over 1100 images to train.
 
 
 Mask_Detector.model, plot.png is the generated by training the training.py script file.
 
 
 Face_detector folder contains two files that is used to detect faces.
 
 
 Detection.py uses openCV and files in Face_detector folder to detect faces with masks.
